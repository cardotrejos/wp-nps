## Executive Summary

**Critical Finding:** Delighted (a major player) is sunsetting by June 2026, creating a significant market opportunity. Combined with the lack of WhatsApp-native NPS solutions, FlowPulse has a clear differentiation path.

**Market Landscape:**

- Enterprise-focused tools ($200-800+/mo) dominate: AskNicely, Qualtrics
- Mid-market options ($89-200/mo): Wootric, Zonka, Retently
- SMB gap: Few quality options at $49-149/mo price point
- WhatsApp gap: No truly WhatsApp-NATIVE solution exists

**Strengths:**

## WhatsApp Survey Landscape

### Current WhatsApp-Capable Tools

| Tool                     | WhatsApp Support | Native?             | Notes                                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Zonka Feedback**       | ✅               | No - channel add-on | Multi-channel, WhatsApp is one option |
| **SurveySensum**         | ✅               | No - channel add-on | Enterprise-focused                    |
| **Messangi**             | ✅               | Partial             | WhatsApp Business integration         |
| **Generic Survey Tools** | Via Twilio/API   | No                  | DIY integration required              |

**Key Insight:** No tool is **WhatsApp-NATIVE**. All treat WhatsApp as just another channel. None are built FROM WhatsApp first.

**Regional Preference Data:**

- India: WhatsApp surveys preferred
- LATAM: WhatsApp dominant for business communication
- US/EU: Email and SMS preferred

**FlowPulse Differentiation:** "WhatsApp-ONLY. Not 'also WhatsApp.' We ARE WhatsApp."

## Strategic Opportunities for FlowPulse

### 1. Delighted Migration Wave (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Timeline:** July 2025 - June 2026
**Opportunity Size:** Thousands of SMB customers seeking new home
**Action:**

- Create "Delighted Migration" landing page
- Offer data import assistance
- Target Shopify-using Delighted customers specifically
- Position as "simple like Delighted, but WhatsApp-native"

### 2. SMB Price Gap

**Situation:** Quality NPS tools either free (limited) or $200+/mo
**Opportunity:** $49-149/mo segment is underserved
**Action:**

- Lead with value: "5x response rates at half the price"
- Free tier (50 surveys) removes friction
- Simple pricing - no sales calls required

### 3. WhatsApp-Native Positioning

**Situation:** Competitors treat WhatsApp as add-on channel
**Opportunity:** Own the WhatsApp NPS category
**Action:**

- "Turn silence into signal" messaging
- Target LATAM and India markets first
- Emphasize response rate differential (5x vs email)
- Alerts delivered TO WhatsApp (owner's phone)

### 4. E-commerce/Shopify Focus

**Situation:** Delighted had Shopify integration, is shutting down
**Opportunity:** Capture Shopify NPS market
**Action:**

- Shopify App Store listing (per prior research)
- Post-purchase survey automation
- Order-linked feedback (know which product, which order)

---

## Competitive Positioning Statement

**For** e-commerce businesses in WhatsApp-dominant markets
**Who** need customer feedback but get low response rates from email surveys
**FlowPulse** is a WhatsApp-native NPS platform
**That** delivers 5x higher response rates by meeting customers where they already are
**Unlike** Delighted, AskNicely, or Wootric
**FlowPulse** is built FROM WhatsApp, not bolted onto it, with SMB-friendly pricing ($49-149/mo)
